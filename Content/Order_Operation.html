    <div class = "operations_body">
        <p>Operations mean adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, etc. 
            So, the order of operations is a set of rules to solve a mathematical 
            expression in the correct order.</p>

        <p>When we see a problem like this: 2 x 4 - 3, should we multiply 2 and 4 or subtract 3 from 4? </p>
        <p>The right way is to multiply 2 and 4 and then subtract later:</p>
            <ul>2 x 4 - 3</ul>

            <ul>= 8 - 3</ul>  
            
            <ul>= 5</ul>

            <p> The order of operations is:</p>

            <ul> <b>P</b>arentheses &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>( )</b>, </ul>

            <ul> <b>E</b>xponents &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>x<sup>2</sup></b>, </ul>

            <ul> <b>M</b>ultiplication or <b>D</b>ivision &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>X</b> or <b>÷</b>, </ul>

            <ul> <b>A</b>ddition or <b>S</b>ubtraction &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>+</b> or <b> -</b></ul>

        <p>Remember these by the acronym <b>PEMDAS</b>. Parentheses will have higher preferences than 
           exponents and exponents will have higher preferences than multiplication or division, and so on.</p> 

        <p>In the previous example, we multiplied first and then subtracted 
           later because multiplication has higher order than subtraction.</p>

        <p>Let's take another example:</p>

        <ul>(2+3) + 4 x 2 </ul>
           
        <ul> = 5 + 4 x 2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We solved everything that was inside the <b>parenthesis</b> </ul>  
           
        <ul>  = 5 + 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We <b>multiplied</b> 4 and 2 to get 8 </ul>  
           
        <ul>  = 13 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We <b>added</b> 5 and 8 to get 13 </ul>  
           
        <p>Did you see the order of operations? Parenthesis was followed by multiplication and addition. 
            We didn't work with exponents, division, or subtraction, because the equation didn't contain those.</p>  
           
        <p>Here's another example:</p>
           
        <ul> 5<sup>2</sup> x 2 ÷ (3 x 4 - 2) </ul> 
           
        <ul> = 5<sup>2</sup> x 2 ÷ (12 - 2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We multiplied 3 and 4 to get 12 inside the <b>parenthesis</b> </ul>
           
        <ul>  = 5<sup>2</sup> x 2 ÷ 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We subtracted 2 from 12 to get 10 inside the <b>parenthesis</b>  </ul> 
           
        <ul>  = 25 x 2 ÷ 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We worked with <b>exponents</b> 5 to the power of 2 is 25 </ul>
           
        <ul> = 50 ÷ 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We <b>multiplied</b> 25 and 2 to get 50 </ul>
           
        <ul> = 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We <b>divided</b> 50 by 10 to get 5 </ul>
           
        <p>Notice that we multiplied first and divided later even though multiplication and 
            division get the same preference. <b>If multiplication and division come side by side, 
            we choose the one on the left.</b> This applies to addition and subtraction.</p>

        <p>Here are two examples:</p>

        <p>1) Multiplying first because it is on the left of Division</p>
        
        <ul>10 x 2 ÷ 5</ul>
        <ul>= 20 ÷ 5 </ul>
        <ul>= 4 </ul>

        <p>2) Dividing first because it is on the left of Multiplication</p>
        <ul>10 ÷ 2 x 5</ul>
        <ul>= 5 x 5</ul>
        <ul> = 25</ul>
