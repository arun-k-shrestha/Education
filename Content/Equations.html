    <p>What is an equation?</p>
    
    <p><ul>An equation is a statement saying that two values/expressions are the same. The values/expressions are separated by an equal sign ( = ). </ul></p>
    
    <p>Examples:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>4 + 4 = 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, 4 + 4 has some value which is equal to 8.</li>
        <li>5x + 2x = 7x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, 5x+ 2x is an algebraic expression and it is equal to 7x which is also an algebraic expression. They are separated by an equal sign. </li>
        <li>2x<sup>2</sup> + 3x<sup>2</sup> = 5x<sup>2</sup></li>
    </ul>

    <p></p>More example:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>5 + x = 8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also an equation. We will see how it is true.</li>
        <li>9 - x = 2 </li>
       
    </ul>

    <p>Starting with 5 + x = 8.</p>
    <p>It means 5 plus some number is equal to 8. Instead of saying some number, we can call it x or y or any other variables. Just by looking at the equation, we can tell that x is equal to 3. Because <b>5 + 3 = 8</b>. </p>
    
    <p>Coming back to 9 - x = 2. If we take away some numbers from 9, we will have 2. So, is x equal to 7? Because, <b>9 - 7 = 2 </b>? Yes.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>These were easy questions. When it comes to little complex problems, we need different ways to tackle the problem. </p>
    <p>We can tackle the problems by <b>adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing </b> the variables or numbers.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b>The goal is to find the value of a variable. So, always try to isolate the variable from the numbers.</b></p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b><u>1) Subtracting:</u></b></p>
    <ul>x + 6 = 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the goal is to isolate x from the rest, we can get rid of 6 from the right</ul>
    <ul>We subtract 6 from both sides.</ul>
    <ul>x + 6 - 6 = 10 - 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This way we can cancel out the 6. </ul>
    <ul>x + 0 = 4  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We got this because 6 - 6 is 0 and 10 - 6 is 4x = 4</ul>
    <p> When we add, subtract, multiply or divide numbers or variables, we need to do those on <b>both sides.
        The equation needs to balance out</b>. Think of it as a balance scale. If you reduce the weight on the left side of the scale, 
        you should also reduce the weight on the right side of the scale to balance out.</p>

    <p>Bonus:</p>
    <ul>x + 10 = 15 </ul> 
    <ul>x + 10 - 10 = 15 - 10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subtracting 10 from both sides</ul>
    <ul>x = 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, 10 - 10 is 0 and 15 - 10 is 5 </ul>

    <p>Remember, x + 0 is 0. In fact, any number added with the 0 will be the same number. 6 + 0 = 6.</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p><b><u>2) Adding:</u></b></p>
    <ul>x - 5 = 10</ul>
    <ul>x - 5+ 5 = 10 + 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding 5 on both sides. This way, we can get ride of 5.</ul>
    <ul>x = 15  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, 5 + 5 is 0 and 10 + 5 is 15</ul>

    <p>Let's take the same example:</p>

    <ul>x - 5 = 10 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Instead of adding 5 lets subtract 5 from both sides.</ul>
    <ul>x -5 - 5 = 10 - 5</ul>
    <ul>x - 10 = 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We wanted to get rid of 5, but we got -10 instead. So, subtracting didn't work in this case.</ul>


    <p><b>If you see a positive number, subtract the number from both sides. If you see a negative number, add the numbers on both sides.</b></p>
    
    <p>More example:</p>
    <ul>10 - x = 20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since x is negative, let's make it positive first by adding the x on both sides</ul>
    <ul>10 - x + x = 20 + x  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here, - x plus x is 0</ul>
    <ul>10 = 20 + x </ul> 
    <ul>Now we can get rid of 20 by subtracting 20 from both sides</ul>
    <ul>10 - 20 = 20 - 20 + x  </ul>
    <ul>-10 = x &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 minus 20 is - 10. Taking away 20 from 10 is more negative.</ul>
    <ul>So, x = -10</ul>
